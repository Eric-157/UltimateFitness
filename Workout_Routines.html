                <h1>Introduction to Working Out With Weights</h1>
                <p>One rule when making weightlifting workout programs is to make sure to split it so that you aren't over-training. Doing chest on Monday, then triceps on Tuesday, then shoulders on Wednesday will overtrain your triceps. Why? Because just about every chest and shoulder exercise works the triceps secondary. And, almost every back exercise works the biceps secondary. So, you would need to do one of three things when making your workout routines and splits:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Work chest, triceps and shoulders on the same day, and biceps and back on the same day so that it's okay if the secondary muscles get worked that day, because you're doing them anyway.</li>
                    <li>Separate those muscles that work a secondary muscle so that they are far enough apart not to overtrain you. For example, do chest and biceps Monday, triceps Wednesday, and shoulders and back Friday.</li>
                    <li>Do chest and triceps Monday, and shoulders Thursday, and back and biceps together on Friday.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>While there are a variety of weightlifting routines available, a very popular routine is a split routine where you work different body parts on alternating days of the week. A sample split routine is shown below.</p>
                <h2>Sample Split Routine</h2>
                    <!-- yo ryan, this is like a grid thing, idk, it looks dumb. It's the text under the Sample split routine on page 8 of part 7.it looks to be 2 columns, 2 rows, so figure out how you want to do that.-->
