                    Give some thought on the following statements:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the past, health meant only absence of disease. Today we have a much broader perspective and consider physical fitness to be a key component of total health.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The modern lifestyle fosters unfitness because technological advances have eliminated much fitness producing physical exertion from everyday activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Everyday activities, even for the laborer, no longer adequately stimulate the heart, lungs, and muscles to produce physiological benefits.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Society, especially the corporate world, is beginning to realize the importance of health promotion and the role of exercise in developing and maintaining good health habits.

                    <li>
                        Being physically fit means living at your fullest physical potential. Physical fitness is the capability of the heart, blood vessels, lungs, and muscles to function at optimal efficiency. It provides a basis for living a full and rewarding life.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The basic health components of physical fitness are cardio-respiratory endurance, strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body composition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To be physically fit does take effort (yes, some sweat, too!), but exercise does not have to be punishing to help you develop and maintain physical fitness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Regular and vigorous exercise of the total body is a necessary ingredient of muscular and circulatory fitness - the key to good health and well-being.
